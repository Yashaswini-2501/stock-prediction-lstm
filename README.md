# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project is a **Stock Price Prediction Model** built with **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks and deployed using **Streamlit**.  
It predicts future stock prices based on historical data.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Uses **LSTM deep learning model** for time-series forecasting.
- Interactive **Streamlit web app** for predictions.
- Includes trained model (`.keras`) and notebook (`.ipynb`) for experimentation.
- Requirements file included for easy setup.
